### Overview:
IG is the name of the agent we created to play the board game ”RoPaSci360”. The 
structure which IG used was inspired by reinforcement learning where an agent learns by 
collecting reward and then constantly approximating the innate value function. However, 
due to our inability and lack of knowledge to implement some crucial techniques used in 
RL, like using Deep Neural Network to learn a value function approximator and using 
machine learning to find best features to represent states etc. In the end, we managed to 
implement a shallow paradigm which utilises the reward mechanism to make our agent 
perform complex actions. On the way of improvising, Li, by using the reward mechanism as 
an evaluation model, also developed a prediction system of the opponent which can 
predict the opponent's next greedy move and take advantage of it. Also temporal 
difference learning was also implemented to help IG to learn better value representation of 
each state he visited.
